# WECC-data
This repository includes settings file to run PowerGenome. PowerGenome results in output files such as generators variability and load estimation for future. We use these files as input for our capacity expansion optimization model.

2045_settings.yml is an old version of the setting file I was using. For now, this can be ingored.

"2030" is the folder I am currently using. You can use csv files and the setting file in this folder to run PowerGenome. It will create 12-zone input data for expansion models targeting the year 2030.

You have to put this "2030" folder in PowerGenome folder, which is created after cloning PowerGenome repo from GitHub.
